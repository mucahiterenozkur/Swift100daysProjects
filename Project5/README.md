Word Scramble Game

I learned a little bit more about UITableView: how to reload their data and how to insert rows.
I also learned how to add text fields to UIAlertController so that I can accept user input. 
But I also learned some serious core stuff: more about Swift strings, closures, NSRange, and more.
These are things I'am going to use in dozens of projects over MY Swift coding career. ❤️ <br>
