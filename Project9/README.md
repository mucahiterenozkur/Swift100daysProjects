# Whitehouse Petitions

In this project I learned how to download JSON using Swiftâ€™s Data type, then use the Codable protocol to convert that data into Swift objects we defined.
Working with JSON is something I'm going to be doing time and time again in my Swift career while also learning about UITabBarController, UIStoryboard, and more.
